	 <h2>The story</h2>

	
	Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
	They said,<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	<q> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> 
	<br><br>
	The farmer said,
	<br><br>
	<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong> </q>
	<br><br>
	 The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
	
	
	<q class="village">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!
	<br><br>
	</q > The farmer again said, <br><br>
	<q class="village"><em>Maybe.</em> </q> 
    <br><br>
   The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, 
   <br><br>
   <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> 
   <br><br>
   and the farmer responded,
   <br><br>
    <strong>“Maybe.”</strong>
	<br><br>
	The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
   
   <br><br>
<q> Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, 
<br><br>
<em>“Maybe.”</em>
<br><br>
	The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

<p> <span> Good </a>and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
